Rice sources of antioxidants, minerals and vitamins, Cashews have a rich nutty flavor, similar to almonds or peanuts. When pureed, it may be hard to distinguish cashew butter from other nut butter like peanut or almond.Swapping out cashews depends on how you are using them. If you are using the cashews as nuts in a trail mix or other nut-based recipe, try pine nuts, almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts, or sunflower seeds. If you are swapping the cashews for some other vegan/vegetarian puree, try a combination of zucchini and macadamia nuts or silken tofu.',
